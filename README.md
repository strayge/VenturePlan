## Venture Plan [mod]

This is modified version of [Venture Plan](https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/venture-plan) addon written by **Foxlit**.
 
Thanks him for awesome math model and first real fight simulation.

### Original description

Venture Plan modifies the Command Table interface for Adventure missions, showing you a more detailed overview of the available missions, and revealing additional information about adventure combat mechanics. The included Cursed Adventurer's Guide is able to foretell your companions' gruesome demise before you send them off on that fatal mission.

Please note that the included Cursed Adventurer's Guide is cursed, and may not always provide accurate visions of the future. As your companions complete adventures, you will accumulate Adventure Reports in-game. Missions where the Guide is particularly likely to be wrong are marked with a warning sign.
